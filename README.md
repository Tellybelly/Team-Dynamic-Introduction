# Team-Dynamic-Introduction

Namaste,
It could have been anybody else, but the 6 of us gathered 
to discover our skills in coding. We expected a fun start 
for this program, and we were right;from our discussion, we figured out that 
2 of us knew how to code, the other 4 did not,
meaning that 33.33% knew how to code. Don’t get the wrong idea. 
All of us loved our previous careers – we got the coolest jobs before we 
decided to become future coders. Have you ever met someone who has done 
Working for Mattel? Working life can be stressful, but we still restore 
work-life balance by watching action or playing Dota 2. We all 
enjoy these simple things in our own free time, and if you didn’t know, our 
team congratulates Cassius for watching their child grow.  

Nice meeting you all!


❤️ Juan Vives, Shantanu Behl, Cassius Hall,Ifeoluwa Ajala, Khoa Le, Krystel Lualhati
